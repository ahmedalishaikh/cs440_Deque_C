Templated Deque that is templated using the preprocessor. To invoke the Deque "class", you must:

add the line:
Deque_Define(VariableType)

before the main function. There is no semicolon at the end of the line. Then you must define a comparison function,
even for primitive types. The Deque is declared and instantiated in the following manner:

Deque_VariableType deq(&deq, comparison_function);

See the test for examples.


FUTURE PLAN:

As of right now, the Deque runs in C++ only due to the use of iostream functions. Plan to make it C exclusive, as it
would create a templated C class (very useful).
