Deque that is templated using the preprocessor to do string replacement. To invoke the Deque class for a particular data type, you must add the line:

Deque_Define(VariableType)

before the main function. There is no semicolon at the end of the line. Then you must define a comparison function, even for primitive types. The Deque is declared and instantiated in the following manner:

Deque_VariableType deq(&deq, comparison_function);

See the test functions for examples.
